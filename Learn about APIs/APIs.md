<p align="center">This Project is basically about researching about APIs. like What is APIs, 
How an API works, Where we can use them, What are the beginner's friendly Projects based on APIs, and many more...

## What is APIs?
APIs (Application programming interfaces), simplify software development and innovation by enabling applications to exchange data and functionality easily and securely.

It enables companies to open up their applications’ data and functionality to external third-party developers, business partners, and internal departments within their companies.
This allows services and products to communicate with each other and leverage each other’s data and functionality through a documented interface. 

Developers don't need to know how an API is implemented; they simply use the interface to communicate with other products and services. API use has surged over the past decade,
to the degree that many of the most popular web applications today would not be possible without APIs.


## How an API works?
An API is a set of defined rules that explain how computers or applications communicate with one another. APIs sit between an application and the web server, acting as an intermediary layer that processes data transfer between systems.

Here’s how an API works:

**1. A client application initiates an API call** to retrieve information—also known as a request. This request is processed from an application to the web server via the API’s URI and includes a request verb, headers, and sometimes, a request body.

**2. After receiving a valid request**, the API makes a call to the external program or web server.

**3. The server sends a response** to the API with the requested information.

**4. The API transfers the data** to the initial requesting application.

## Types of APIs
Nowadays, most application programming interfaces are web APIs that expose an application's data and functionality over the internet. Here are the four main types of web API:

- Open APIs

- Partner APIs

- Internal APIs

- Composite APIs

## Why we need APIs?
Whether you’re managing existing tools or designing new ones, you can use an application programming interface to simplify the process. 

Some of the main benefits of APIs include the following:

- Improved collaboration

- Easier innovation

- Data monetization

- Added security

## Types of API protocols?
As the use of web APIs has increased, certain protocols have been developed to provide users with a set of defined rules that specifies the accepted data types and commands. In effect, these API protocols facilitate standardized information exchange:

- SOAP

- XML-RPC

- JSON-RPC

- REST

## Where APIs can used?
APIS can be used in many ways but i listed some of them : 

- **Financial institutions** like banks use private APIs to track and manage checking accounts, credit cards, and more.

- **Retail giants** use APIs to communicate with courier networks, ensuring packages are picked up as soon as possible and tracking them as they are moved.

- **Web applications** use APIs to connect user-facing front ends with all-important back end functionality and data.

- **Streaming services** like Spotify and Netflix use APIs to distribute content.

- **Automotive** companies like Tesla send software updates via APIs. Others use APIs to unlock car data for third-parties.

## beginner's friendly Projects 
There are lot's of Projects based on APIs but i lissted some of them : 

- **Profile Summary For Github :**  Tool for visualizing GitHubs Profiles.

- **Monkey :**  Monkey is an unofficial GitHub client for iOS,to show the rank of coders and repositories.

- GitHub Hub : A command-line tool that makes git easier to use with GitHub  

- **Github Changelog Generator :** Automatically generate change log from your tags, issue, labels and pull requests on GiHub

- **Forkhub :** GitHub client for Android based on the abandoned official app 

## Final Thoughts
APIs are everywhere, and it only takes picking up your smartphone to see them in action. Whether it’s searching
for the weather on Google, logging-in with Facebook, paying with PayPal, or interacting with a Twitter bot, all
of these things are powered by APIs. To boot, there’s a lot more going on with APIs behind the scenes. We may not 
see them as much, but they’re integral to our daily digital lives.
