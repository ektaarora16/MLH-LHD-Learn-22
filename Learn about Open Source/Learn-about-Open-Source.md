<h1 align="center"> <code> Learn about Open Source </code></h1>
<p align="center"> Everyone is talking about contributing to open source but how exactly do you go about contributing to a project? </p>

Contributing to open source can improve your technical skills and your communication skills. It can help you network with other developers and can even help you land a job.

Anyone can make a helpful open source contribution, from a complete beginner to an experienced developer.

Here are the topics covered in this course:

- What is Open Source 

- Why you should care about Open Source

- What is Git

- Ways to Use Git

- What is GitHub

- Example of a custom GitHub profile

- GitHub features

- GitHub Actions for Continuous Integration (CI)

- Insights tab for more project information

## What is Open Source?
Open source is a term that originally referred to open source software (OSS). Open source software is code that is designed to be publicly accessibleâ€”anyone can see, modify, and distribute the code as they see fit.

Open source software is developed in a decentralized and collaborative way, relying on peer review and community production. Open source software is often cheaper, more flexible, and has more longevity than its proprietary peers because it is developed by communities rather than a single author or company.

Open source has become a movement and a way of working that reaches beyond software production. The open source movement uses the values and decentralized production model of open source software to find new ways to solve problems in their communities and industries.

## Why you should care about Open Source?
Open source is a hot topic. Barely a day goes by without a major announcement in the computer press about open source: companies introducing new initiatives such as Sun releasing Solaris 10 as open source; established vendors ploughing huge amounts of resource into open source projects (e.g. IBM donating millions of dollars to the Eclipse project); and venture capitalists flocking to fund open source companies (e.g. SugarCRM, SpikeSource).

Many of the world's most successful companies attribute at least some of their success to open source software (OSS). Amazon runs on the open source Apache web server. Large parts of Yahoo! are built on Linux, FreeBSD and Apache, and written in PHP and Perl.

It's no coincidence that these successful companies use OSS. They have leveraged its flexibility to build bespoke systems at a fraction of what similar proprietary systems would have cost.

## What is Git
Git is the most commonly used version control system. Git tracks the changes you make to files, so you have a record of what has been done, and you can revert to specific versions should you ever need to. Git also makes collaboration easier, allowing changes by multiple people to all be merged into one source. 

So regardless of whether you write code that only you will see, or work as part of a team, Git will be useful for you.

## Ways to Use Git?
Git is software that you can access via a command line (terminal), or a desktop app that has a GUI (graphical user interface) such as Sourcetree shown below.

## What is GitHub?
GitHub is a web-based interface that uses Git, the open source version control software that lets multiple people make separate changes to web pages at the same time. As Carpenter notes, because it allows for real-time collaboration, GitHub encourages teams to work together to build and edit their site content.

## Example of a custom GitHub profile
There are lot's example of custom GitHub Profile. If you want to make your GitHub Profile like them than see their code and make your's GitHub Profile like them

## GitHub features
There are lots of features in GitHub. I listed some of them ðŸ‘‡

- Drag and Drop Gist Code

- Creating a folder via the Web Interface

-  Using Git URL Shortener

- File Finder

- Using Github Emoji

- Using Github Command Line Interface

- Linking Lines

- Task Checklist

-  Map, CSV and 3D Rendering

- Get Octodex, **etc**

## GitHub Actions for Continuous Integration (CI)
To create a workflow, you start by using a template. A template has common jobs and steps pre-configured for the particular type of automation you're implementing. If you're not familiar with workflows, jobs, and steps, check out the Automate development tasks by using GitHub Actions module.

On the main page of your repository, select the Actions tab to create a new workflow. You'll see that you can choose from many different templates. Two examples are the Node.js template, which does a clean install of node dependencies, builds the source code and runs tests across different versions of Node; and the Python package template, which installs Python dependencies and runs tests, including lint, across different versions of Python.

## Insights tab for more project information
The Insights tab in the right sidebar in TaskRay is designed to provide a quick project health summary. It contains two sub-tabs: Overview and Charts. Under Overview, you will see four different sections that will display information, such as status updates, important milestones and dates, a summary of tasks that are at risk, as well as the distribution of tasks by status and team member. Under Charts, you will have the ability to make ad hoc charts using task information.

## GitHub Discussions for threaded conversations
GitHub Discussions is a collaborative communication forum for the community around an open source project. Community members can ask and answer questions, share updates, have open-ended conversations, and follow along on decisions affecting the community's way of working.

## How to find Open Source projects?
You can find ways to contribute to open source projects on GitHub that are relevant to you. :- 

- Discovering relevant projects

- Finding good first issues

- Opening an issue

- Validating an issue or pull request

- Further reading

## How to write Markdown?
Markdown is a scripting language that is very lightweight. It is used to format plain text to a respective design. Markdowns are rapidly used in content writing in some blog post web sites. It converts some plain text to the desired format in HTML. The simplicity and easy to understand is making the markdown more popular. It takes all the text from the markdown file and converts to HTML through a markdown app or a compiler.

If you are a beginner to markdown file then this article is for you. I am going to write a readme.md file so that you will have a better understanding of the markdown script.
Here I am using visual studio code IDE for writing markdown file. Below are the steps to create a markdown file in visual studio code.

Step-1: Open visual studio code and goto file > new file

Step-2: Name the file as readme.md or readme.markdown and save the file.

Step-3: Find and click the â€˜open preview to the sideâ€™ icon.

Step-4: Start writing the script:- 

- Headings : use # for h1 and ## for h2 and so on..

- Normal Text : If you want to write normal text then write simple text here, no need to add any tags it will automatically convert into text.

- Hyperlinks : ```[link name](targetURL)```

- Strong and italic text : ```_Italic text here_```

- StrikeThrough : ```~~Strikethrough text~~```

- Images : ```![imagename](TargetUrl)```

- Tables :  ``` |Name|Email|Address|      <====== This is the heading of the table
                |----|-----|-------|      <====== This is the separator.
                |John|john@example.com|Address1| <=== This is the table body.
            ```
- Quotes : ```>Your quote looks like this.```

- code : You can write code by appending ` symbol at the beginning and end of the line

- Code block : ```Language
                  your code
               ```
- List :   ``` 1. Item 1
              2. Item 2
              3. Item 3
                 * Sub item 1
                 * Sub item 3
              * Unordered item
              * Unordered item
              * Unordered item
          ```
- Horizontal line :  ```--- or ***```
